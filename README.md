# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains the C++ code for the data structures and algorithms presented in the book *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

The code is well-commented and easy to understand. It is also well-tested, with unit tests for each data structure and algorithm.

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* `data_structures`: This directory contains the code for the data structures presented in the book.
* `algorithms`: This directory contains the code for the algorithms presented in the book.

To get started, simply clone the repository and open the `main.cpp` file in your favorite IDE. You can then run the code by clicking the "Run" button.

This repository is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn about data structures and algorithms in C++. It is also a valuable reference for experienced programmers who need to implement these data structures and algorithms in their own code.
